--Elm 0.19 Boilerplate for Browser.document Applications--

Interested in creating an application in Elm v0.19 with more than just the simple "Browser.sandbox" and "Browser.element" examples found in the official guide? This boilerplate will provide you with a solid starting point for getting an app up and running in the browser. By using this boilerplate, you will be able to create a single web page and style your application using regular css files linked to the html page.

To get started, clone this repository to your own machine, and type "elm init" in the terminal. This will prompt you to approve the creation of an elm.json file. Once this is complete you can begin writing your Elm code in the "Main.elm" file. Once you are ready to run the program in your browser, run the command "elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js" in the terminal from the directory where the boilerplate was saved. This will compile your elm code to a JavaScript file. Open the index.html file in a browser to see your new web page!
